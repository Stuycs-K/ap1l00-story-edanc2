Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <monkey>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <dog>, I thought I would <plop> about
a little and see the <long> part of the <keyboard>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<wire> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <leg>;
whenever it is a <flat>, <flimsy> November in my <paper>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<watching> before coffin <ceiling>, and bringing up the rear of every <person> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <bright>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <scrolling> into the <park>, and methodically
<feeling> people's <purses> off—then, I account it high time to get to <wallet> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <device> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <hippo> with me.
