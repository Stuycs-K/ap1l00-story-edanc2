Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <horse>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <house>, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <small> part of the <building>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<popcorn> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <tornado>;
whenever it is a <massive>, <huge> November in my <train>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<running> before coffin <abode>, and bringing up the rear of every <donkey> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <funny>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <flying> into the <state>, and methodically
<touching> people's <jumbles> off—then, I account it high time to get to <computer> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <telephone> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <mouse> with me.
