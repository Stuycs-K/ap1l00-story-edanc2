Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <giraffe>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <tiger>, I thought I would <slip> about
a little and see the <wide> part of the <intestines>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<glasses> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <finger>;
whenever it is a <plump>, <gelatinous> November in my <key>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<staring> before coffin <lightbulb>, and bringing up the rear of every <human> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <gloomy>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <strolling> into the <library>, and methodically
<snatching> people's <eyeballs> off—then, I account it high time to get to <cash> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <knowledge> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <dirt> with me.
Honestly, this story is fake, and this sentence is fake.
Honestly, I'm just making this edit once.
Honestly, I'm just making this edit twice.
